Genetic testing plays a vital role in enhancing fertility outcomes. Ayuh Fertility Centre explains that by identifying chromosomal abnormalities or hereditary disorders, doctors can personalize treatment plans and avoid repeated IVF failures. Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) ensures only healthy embryos are implanted, increasing the chances of success and reducing miscarriage risks. Itâ€™s especially helpful for couples with a history of failed IVF, recurrent pregnancy loss, or known genetic conditions. Genetic screening empowers couples with knowledge and provides clarity about their reproductive health. Learn how Ayuh Fertility Centre integrates advanced genetic solutions into IVF plans here:
